napalm-ansible
==============

Collection of ansible modules that use `napalm <https://github.com/napalm-automation/napalm>`_ to retrieve data or modify configuration on networking devices.

Modules
-------

The following modules are currently available:

* napalm_get_facts
* napalm_install_config
* napalm_validate

Install
-------

To install, clone napalm-ansible into your ansible module path. This will depend on your own setup and contents of your ansible.cfg file which tells ansible where to look for modules. For more in-depth explanation, see the `Ansible Docs <http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/intro_configuration.html#library>`_.


If your ansible.cfg looks like::

    [defaults]
    library = ~/workspace/napalm-ansible


Then you can do the following::

    cd ~/workspace

    git clone


If your ansible.cfg looks like::


    [defaults]
    library = ~/workspace/napalm-ansible

Then you can do the following::


    cd ~/workspace

    git clone https://github.com/napalm-automation/napalm-ansible.git



    user@hostname:~/workspace ls -la
    total 12
    drwxrwxr-x 3 user user 4096 Feb 26 12:51 .
    drwxr-xr-x 7 user user 4096 Feb 26 12:49 ..
    drwxrwxr-x 5 user user 4096 Feb 26 12:51 napalm-ansible

From here you would add your playbook(s) for your project, for example::


    mkdir ansible-playbooks

    user@hostname:~/workspace ls -la
    total 12
    drwxrwxr-x 3 user user 4096 Feb 26 12:51 .
    drwxr-xr-x 7 user user 4096 Feb 26 12:49 ..
    drwxrwxr-x 5 user user 4096 Feb 26 12:51 napalm-ansible
    drwxrwxr-x 5 user user 4096 Feb 26 12:53 ansible-playbooks


Dependencies
------------

`napalm <https://github.com/napalm-automation/napalm>`_ 1.00.0 or later

Examples
--------

Example to retrieve facts from a device::

     - name: get facts from device
       napalm_get_facts:
         hostname={{ inventory_hostname }}
         username={{ user }}
         dev_os={{ os }}
         password={{ passwd }}
         filter='facts,interfaces,bgp_neighbors'
       register: result

     - name: print data
       debug: var=result

Example to install config on a device::

    - assemble:
        src=../compiled/{{ inventory_hostname }}/
        dest=../compiled/{{ inventory_hostname }}/running.conf

     - napalm_install_config:
        hostname={{ inventory_hostname }}
        username={{ user }}
        dev_os={{ os }}
        password={{ passwd }}
        config_file=../compiled/{{ inventory_hostname }}/running.conf
        commit_changes={{ commit_changes }}
        replace_config={{ replace_config }}
        get_diffs=True
        diff_file=../compiled/{{ inventory_hostname }}/diff


Example to get compliance report::

    - name: GET VALIDATION REPORT
      napalm_validate:
        username: "{{ un }}"
        password: "{{ pwd }}"
        hostname: "{{ inventory_hostname }}"
        dev_os: "{{ dev_os }}"
        validation_file: validate.yml



A More Detailed Example
-----------------------

It's very often we come to these tools needing to know how to run before we can walk.
Please review the `Ansible Documentation <http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/playbooks.html>`_ as this will answer some basic questions.
It is also advised to have some kind of `yaml linter <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/yamllint>`_ or syntax checker available.

Non parameterized example with comments to get you started::

    - name: Test Inventory #The Task Name
      hosts: cisco         #This will be in your ansible inventory file
      connection: local    #Required
      gather_facts: no     #Do not gather facts

      tasks:                                     #Begin Tasks
        - name: get facts from device            #Task Name
          napalm_get_facts:                      #Call the napalm module, in this case napal_get_facts
            optional_args: {'secret': password}  #The enable password for Cisco IOS
            hostname: "{{ inventory_hostname }}" #This is a parameter and is derived from your ansible inventory file
            username: 'user'                     #The username to ssh with
            dev_os: 'ios'                        #The hardware operating system
            password: 'password'                 #The line level password
            filter: 'facts'                      #The list of items you want to retrieve. The filter keyword is _inclusive_ of what you want
          register: result                       #Ansible function for collecting output

        - name: print results                    #Task Name
          debug: msg="{{ result }}"              #Display the collected output


Keeping with our example dir at the beginning of the Readme, we now have this layout::

    user@host ~/workspace/ansible-playbooks
    08:16 $ ls -la
    total 32
    drwxrwxr-x 3 user user 4096 Feb 26 07:24 .
    drwxrwxr-x 8 user user 4096 Feb 25 16:32 ..
    -rw-rw-r-- 1 user user  404 Feb 26 07:24 inventory.yaml


You would run this playbook like as::

  cd ~/workspace

  ansible-playbook ansible-playbooks/inventory.yaml


And it should produce output similar to this::
